1. Write a loop that plays "99 bottles of beer" song. It should say bottle instead of bottles when there's only one, and the song is over when there are 0 bottles.

2. Write the loop and code necessary to sum all integers between 1 to 100, including 100.

3. Write a loop that starts at 1 and goes to 100. for each number that is a multiple of 3, output the string "Fizz". For each number that is a multiple of 5, output the string "Buzz". For numbers that are multiples of both 3 and 5, output "FizzBuzz".. For all other numbers, output the number itself.
