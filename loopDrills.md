1. Write a loop that plays "99 bottles of beer" song. It should say bottle instead of bottles when there's only one, and the song is over when there are 0 bottles.

2. Write the loop and code necessary to sum all integers between 1 to 100, including 100.

3. Write a loop that starts at 1 and goes to 100. for each number that is a multiple of 3, output the string "Fizz". For each number that is a multiple of 5, output the string "Buzz". For numbers that are multiples of both 3 and 5, output "FizzBuzz".. For all other numbers, output the number itself.

Output:
1
2
"Fizz"
4
"Buzz"
"Fizz"
7
8
"Fizz"
"Buzz"
11
"Fizz"
13
14
"FizzBuzz"
16
...

4. Write the code/loop that outputs the first 20 Fibonacci numbers.


make a loop that counts from 1 to 10

make a loop that counts from 20 to 30
make a loop that counts from 1 to 100
make a loop that counts from 1 to 1000
make a loop that starts at 10 and ends at 0
make a loop that starts at 20 and ends at -20

prompt the user for a starting number, store the answer in a variable named "start"
prompt the user for an ending number, store the value in a variable named "end"
prompt the user for a number to count by, assign the value to a varialbe named "countBy"
