## Rationale:
Drills are purposeful rehearsal aimed at improving performance. Pracitioners need drills to drill competency and invest in automaticity.

## Getting Started:

- Make sure you've already got node installed.
- clone this repository 
- `npm install`
- `npm run`
- navigate your browser to `http://localhost:port` where port is displayed in 

or

- Remix in glitch with one click, then click "Show" to launch the application.

## Topics and tags

- introduce objects before explaining them, e.g. <input name="password">
- Literal primitive values
- Data types
- Booleans
- boolean operators (and, not, or)
- statements
- expressions
- identity and non-identity
- equality and inequality
- comparisson operators
- boolean logic operators
- truthy/falsy 
- type casting and juggling
- strings and escape characters
- string concatenation vs addition with +
- string methods
- numbers + basic math
- ternary expressions
- constant assignment
- variable assignment
- variable reassignment
- shortcut operators (++, --, +=, etc...)
- internal functions
- if
- if/else
- nested if statements
- if/else if/else if
- if/else if/else
- switch case
- using functions for conditional logic
- user defined functions
- scope
- adding values and html to the HTML document
- arrays and accessing elements
- array element reassignment
- array functions/methods
- manually iterating across arrays
- while loops
- do while loops
- for loops
- iterating across arrays (manually and w/ a loop)
- forEach loops
- .map
- .filter
- .reduce
- working w/ html objects in js
- internal JS objects (window, Math, etc...)
- user defined objects
- JSON data objects
- reducing to objects and collections
- getting collections onto html
- recursion
- extending prototypes
- classes
- object constructor funtions
- es6 shorthand
- string templates
- arrow functions
- spread operator
- ajax requests
- object creation
- object equality
- array equality

- Common syntactical errors (using assignment operator in an if condition, )

Concepts
- assignment
- comparison
- logical comparison
- associativity property
- communicativity property
- transativity property
- distributive property

## Thoughts for additional material:
- Progression: booleans->numbers->strings->functions->conditionals->arrays->objects->higherOrderFunctions
- Make variables that hold the result of a subjective conditional. (do you like tofu?)
- Make variables that hold the result of an objective conditional. (today is Friday)

- Convert each function to a method on a prototype. Extend object,array, string, number, Math, etc... prototypes

- Convert given functions to methods on a library object like the name of the library or framework

## Drills:
See drills.txt for the complete listing of all drill names with a brief description.
