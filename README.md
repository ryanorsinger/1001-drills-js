## Rationale:
Drills are purposeful rehearsal aimed at improving performance. Pracitioners need drills to drill competency and invest in automaticity.

## Getting Started:


## Thoughts for additional material:
- Progression: booleans->numbers->strings->functions->conditionals->arrays->objects->higherOrderFunctions
- Make variables that hold the result of a subjective conditional. (do you like tofu?)
- Make variables that hold the result of an objective conditional. (today is Friday)

- Convert each function to a method on a prototype. Extend object,array, string, number, Math, etc... prototypes

- Convert given functions to methods on a library object like the name of the library or framework
