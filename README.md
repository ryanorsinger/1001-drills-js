## Rationale:
Drills are purposeful rehearsal aimed at improving performance. Pracitioners need drills to drill competency and invest in automaticity.

## Getting Started:

- Make sure you've already got node installed.
- clone this repository 
- `npm install`
- `npm run`
- navigate your browser to `http://localhost:port` where port is displayed in 

or

- Remix in glitch with one click, then click "Show" to launch the application.

## Topics and tags
Literal primitive values
Data types
statements
expressions
equality and identity
comparisson operators
boolean logic operators
truthy/falsy 
type casting and juggling
strings and string methods
numbers + basic math
ternary expressions
constant assignment
variable assignment
variable reassignment
shortcut operators (++, --, +=, etc...)
internal functions
if
if/else
if/else if/else if
if/else if/else
switch case
using funcitons for predicate logic
scope
user defined functions
adding values and html to the HTML document
arrays and array access
array element reassignment
array functions/methods
manually iterating across arrays
while loops
do while loops
for loops
forEach loops
.map
.filter
.reduce
working w/ html objects in js
internal JS objects (window, Math, etc...)
user defined objects
JSON data objects
reducing to objects and collections
getting collections onto html
recursion
extending prototypes
classes
object constructor funtions
es6 shorthand
string templates
arrow functions
spread operator
ajax requests

## Thoughts for additional material:
- Progression: booleans->numbers->strings->functions->conditionals->arrays->objects->higherOrderFunctions
- Make variables that hold the result of a subjective conditional. (do you like tofu?)
- Make variables that hold the result of an objective conditional. (today is Friday)

- Convert each function to a method on a prototype. Extend object,array, string, number, Math, etc... prototypes

- Convert given functions to methods on a library object like the name of the library or framework
